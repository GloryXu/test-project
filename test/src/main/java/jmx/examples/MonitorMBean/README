                         Monitor MBean Example
                         =====================


-----------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Overview
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

This example shows how to implement a simple agent application that uses the 
monitoring service defined in the JMX specification.

The agent in this example registers a monitor MBean which observes the
number of MBeans registered in the MBean server.

In order to receive information from the monitor, the example also
shows how to implement a notification listener with the JMX
notification model.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------
2. File List
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

This example is based on the following source files:

 * MonitorAgent.java:
    - Creates an MBean server
    - Registers a monitor MBean in the MBean server which sends out a
      notification when the number of registered MBeans exceeds a pre-
      defined threshold
    - Registers many MBeans of class Simple
    - Registers a standard MBean (StandardObservedObject) and then a 
      dynamic MBean (DynamicObservedObject) each having an attribute
      representing the number of MBeans registered in the MBean server
    - Declares a listener for the notifications emitted by the monitor
      MBean
    - Unregisters all of the MBeans	

 * AgentListener.java:
    - Receives the notifications emitted by the monitor MBean

 * Simple.java:
    - A standard MBean

 * SimpleMBean.java:
    - The management interface of the MBean Simple

 * StandardObservedObject.java:
    - A standard MBean having an attribute representing the number of
      MBeans registered in the MBean server

 * StandardObservedObjectMBean.java:
    - The management interface of the MBean StandardObservedObject

 * DynamicObservedObject.java:
    - A dynamic MBean having an attribute representing the number of
      MBeans registered in the MBeanServer

3. Building and Running the Example
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

To build and run this example, make sure that your PATH and CLASSPATH
environment variables are correctly set to use the Java 2 platform. In
addition, your CLASSPATH must also contain the JMX reference implemen-
tation jar file (jmxri.jar), as well as the current directory (.).

These instructions assume the classpath is set in an environment
variable, though it may also be given on the command line with the
-classpath option.

To compile the example, type the following commands:

   cd examples/MonitorMBean/
   javac *.java

To run the example using the classes you have just built, type the
following command:

   java MonitorAgent

You then interact with the agent through the standard input and output
in the window where it was launched. The MonitorAgent class displays
information about each management step and waits for user input before
continuing.
