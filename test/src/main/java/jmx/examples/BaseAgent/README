                         Base Agent Example
                         ==================


-----------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Overview
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

This example shows how to implement a minimal agent application that
can be accessed through a Web browser.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------
2. File List
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

This example is based on the following source file:

 * BaseAgent.java:
    - Creates an MBean server
    - Creates and registers an HTML adaptor server in the MBean server


-----------------------------------------------------------------------
3. Building and Running the Example
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

To build and run this example, make sure that your PATH and CLASSPATH
environment variables are correctly set to use the Java 2 platform. In
addition, your CLASSPATH must also contain the JMX reference implemen-
tation (jmxri.jar) and toolkit (jmxtools.jar) jar files, as well as
the current directory (.).

These instructions assume the classpath is set in an environment
variable, though it may also be given on the command line with the
-classpath option.

To compile the example, type the following commands:

   cd examples/BaseAgent/
   javac *.java

To run the example using the classes you have just built, type the
following command:

   java BaseAgent &

This JMX agent is now running on your machine. To manage the agent
through a Web browser, load the following URL: http://localhost:8082/

You may also access this agent from any remote machine on the same
network by connecting to this URL: http://<agentHostName>:8082/
(where <agentHostName> is the name or IP address of the machine where
you launched the BaseAgent).

Please refer to the tutorial provided in this software bundle for
further instructions about interacting with the JMX agent through the
HTML protocol adaptor.
