                         Model MBean Example
                         ===================


-----------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Overview
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

This example shows how to implement a simple agent application that uses 
the Model MBean defined in the JMX specification.

The agent in this example shows the use of a Model MBean to manage an 
application bean, named "TestBean". It also demonstrates how to have 
attributes in the same ModelMBean supported by methods on different 
objects.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------
2. File List
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

This example is based on the following source files:

 * ModelAgent.java:
    - Creates an MBean server.
    - Registers a Model MBean in the MBean server.
    - Configures the Model MBean in order to manage two simple application  
      beans called "TestBean" and "TestBeanFriend".
    - It registers an object of class "TestBeanAttributeChangeListener" as  
      listener to all notifications emitted when the attribute "State" of   
      the "TestBean" changes.
    - It performs management operations on application beans using the 	    
      Model MBean.

 * TestBeanAttributeChangeListener.java:
    - Implements the javax.management.NotificationListener interface.       
      It receives the attribute change notifications emitted by the Model   
      MBean when the attribute "State" of the "TestBean" changes.

 * TestBean.java:
    - Simple definition of a Bean which is managed by a ModelMBean.

 * TestBeanFriend.java:
    - Simple definition of a Bean which is managed by a ModelMBean.
      It implements the same methods as "TestBean".  It is used by the      
      ModelAgent test program to illustrate and demonstrate how to have     
      attributes in the same ModelMBean supported by methods on different   
      objects.

3. Building and Running the Example
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

To build and run this example, make sure that your PATH and CLASSPATH
environment variables are correctly set to use the Java 2 SDK. In
addition, your CLASSPATH must also contain the JMX reference implemen-
tation jar file (jmxri.jar), as well as the current directory (.).

These instructions assume the classpath is set in an environment
variable, though it may also be given on the command line with the
-classpath option.

Copy the example source files to your 
working directory and type the following commands:

   cd <WORKING_DIR>

   javac *.java


To run the example using the classes you have just built, type the
following command:

   java ModelAgent

You then interact with the agent through the standard input and output
in the window where it was launched. The ModelAgent class displays
information about each management step and waits for user input before
continuing.
