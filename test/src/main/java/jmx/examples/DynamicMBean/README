                         Dynamic MBean Example
                         =====================


-----------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Overview
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

This example shows how to implement a dynamic MBean and manage it
through a simple JMX agent application:

 - Develop a dynamic MBean that implements the DynamicMBean interface
   and correctly exposes its management interface at runtime.

 - Develop a simple JMX agent for exercising the MBean:
    . Initialize the MBean server
    . Add the dynamic MBean to the MBean server
    . Find the MBeans management interface
    . Get and set attributes, invoke operations on the MBean
    . Handle the response when trying to invoke methods not exposed
      for management


-----------------------------------------------------------------------
2. File List
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

This example is based on the following source files:

 * SimpleDynamic.java:
    - A dynamic MBean

 * DynamicAgent.java:
    - Creates an MBean server
    - Registers a dynamic MBean in the MBean server
    - Gets information on the management interface of the MBean
    - Invokes dynamic MBean methods exposed for management with
      success and tries to invoke methods not exposed for management
      without success 


-----------------------------------------------------------------------
3. Building and Running the Example
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

To build and run this example, make sure that your PATH and CLASSPATH
environment variables are correctly set to use the Java 2 platform. In
addition, your CLASSPATH must also contain the JMX reference implemen-
tation jar file (jmxri.jar), as well as the current directory (.).

These instructions assume the classpath is set in an environment
variable, though it may also be given on the command line with the
-classpath option.

To compile the example, type the following commands:

   cd examples/DynamicMBean/
   javac *.java

To run the example using the classes you have just built, type the
following command:

   java DynamicAgent

You then interact with the agent through the standard input and output
in the window where it was launched. The DynamicAgent class displays
information about each management step and waits for user input before
continuing.
