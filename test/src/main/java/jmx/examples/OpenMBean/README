                         Open MBean Example
                         =====================


-----------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Overview
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

This example shows how to implement an open MBean and manage it
through a simple JMX agent application:

 - Develop a sample open MBean that uses some of the open data types
   and correctly exposes its management interface at runtime through
   the OpenMBean*Info classes.

 - Develop a simple JMX agent for exercising the open MBean:
    . Initialize the MBean server
    . Create and add the sample open MBean to the MBean server
    . Get and display the open MBean management information
    . Invoke some operations on the MBean


-----------------------------------------------------------------------
2. File List
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

This example is based on the following source files:

 * SampleOpenMBean.java:
    - An open MBean

 * OpenAgent.java:
    - Simple JMX agent for exercising the open MBean 


-----------------------------------------------------------------------
3. Building and Running the Example
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

To build and run this example, make sure that your PATH and CLASSPATH
environment variables are correctly set to use the Java 2 platform. In
addition, your CLASSPATH must also contain the JMX reference implemen-
tation jar file (jmxri.jar), as well as the JMX tools contributions 
jar file (jmxtools.jar) for the HTML adaptor class, and the current 
directory (.).

These instructions assume the classpath is set in an environment
variable, though it may also be given on the command line with the
-classpath option.

To compile the example, type the following commands:

   cd examples/OpenMBean/
   javac *.java

To run the example using the classes you have just built, type the
following command:

   java OpenAgent

You then interact with the agent through the standard input and output
in the window where it was launched. The OpenAgent class displays
information about each management step and waits for user input before
continuing.
